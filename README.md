# Job Lister

A python script that shows avaliable jobs listed on justjoin.it. The user provides a set of keywords that are then used to search through the site to be later either saved as a file or listed in the terminal. The script uses the provided words as keywords instead of skill/location/category, which results in more offers to go through.

Uses MS Edge webdriver.
